Slipstreaming a new windows image for installation
Ask: Patrick B.

Use for:
	integrating...
		windows updates
		drivers
		software(guide-WIP)
		slimming down an already existing image(guide-WIP)
		automated installs(guide-WIP)
		changing some default services, settings, etc.
		unattended installs

Tools:
	NTLite (makes majority of it easy) https://www.ntlite.com/download/
	windows update catalog
	

Things to know first:
WIM - Windows Image....Media?, it is hte actual windows image similar to an "iso" in a sense or a ghost image
boot.wim - the "windows install screen" version of windows. technically WinPE.
install.wim - the actual INSTALLED windows. It mostly just extracts this onto the HDD and then does setup
*.msu - MS update, can open with 7zip to get .cab out of it if needed
*.cab - cabinet file. basically a zip. used pretty much by just windows

**ALWAYS!!!
work from an "original" image, don't just keep updating an already updated image, the image size will keep growing and become unstable
Often, just get a new windows ISO because they do update the install disc itself also.

notes:

---my setup
c:\w10_extract		extracted windows iso
c:\w10_registry		registries to apply (for ntlite)
c:\w10_updates		collecting the updates (for ntlite)
c:\w10_drivers		drivers (for ntlite)

Summary

quick simple version
1.	extract iso
2.	load with ntlite
3.	make changes and add updates
4.  Save, not ISO
5.	set autoattend.xml in folder
     - decide on autounattend.xml audit mode or done.
     - No software to preinstall? use regular autounattend.xml
6.  create ISO with ntlite
     - if no software, then you are done! use rufus to image iso to usb
7.  install in Virtualbox (mbr is fine)
.  snapshot vbox
8.  boot into audit mode
.  install software
.  remove appx non-provision packages (just adobe probably)
.  dism reset base
.  snapshot vbox
.  generalize and shutdown
.  snapshot vbox
.  add a 'flashdrive' either vhd or real flashdrive
.  boot into winpe and use diskpart to check drive letters
.  capture image then shutdown
.  extract .wim to replace the install.wim. keep the updated .wim someplace incase you need to redo applications
.  create iso and test!

==================================================================================
                  Driver Specific
==================================================================================
some of the drivers are hard to get or need to be extracted
Intel's chipset drivers
SetupChipset.exe -extract <path>

Intel Management Engine
don't bother
if really want to get rid of the missing device driver, -drvonly, or -? for list

==================================================================================
                  Capturing an image (more of notes rather than guide atm)
==================================================================================
Reccomended to do this in a VM like virtualbox
These may need to be run in Admin-CMD to fix Virtualbox/windows security stuff
    dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V
    bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
VM also means less driver installs to do / pollute the image

enter audit mode via autounattend install file or key combo
audit mode is alt+shift+f3? during OOBE
a system can only be sysprep generalized 8? times (i dont know how it tracks)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--generalize--a-windows-installation

Install whatever you need/want. set settings. copy files.
DO NOT install microsoft store apps (unless provisioned)
	adobe will install notifier, remove it
will probably have to remove some apps use Remove-AppxPackage in powershell
	AdobeNotificationCenter - 
		Get-AppxPackage -Name AcrobatNotificationClient | Remove-AppxPackage

(resetbase) cleanup old updates
	DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
	dism /Image:D:\ /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase /ScratchDir:G:\

sysprep generalize shutdown
make a snapshot in vm! (: incase you miss hte boot prompt

boot into windows PE
check disks via `diskpart` and `dir C:\`
dont forget a destination drive to store the image like flashdrive or mounted vhd
capture with
```
	Dism /Capture-Image /ImageFile:"D:\Images\Fabrikam.wim" /CaptureDir:C:\ /Name:Fabrikam
```

======== Autopatcher ==========
Get all of the updates by....
extract/run
"Download Updates"
forget the engine.... checkbox "AutoPatcher for Windows 7 SP1 (x64)" or the appropriate one...
Next..
After downloading DONT run it. just close it.
Inside autopatcher folder, the updates are located in "modules"

YAY "all" updates are now downloaded and offline for use later.
Note: These updates are handpicked by the Autopatcher team. so they dont ACTUALLY contain ALL 
of the updates. They already got rid of superseded ones and sketchy/unreliable ones. It is still about 95% though.
========NTLite=========
Super easy to use, will write guide later

use autopatcher to get the updates offline, located in "modules"
(esp dell) most driver installs let you extract the drivers w/o installing

========DISM=========
lots of dism stuff:
	http://www.msigeek.com/2661/add-or-remove-a-driver-from-a-wim-image-using-dism

create install.wim from a folder
	dism /Capture-Image /ImageFile:c:\data\myData.wim /CaptureDir:C:\data\dataFiles /Name:MyData
OR
commit changes to existing wim
	dism /unmount-Wim  /MountDir:<mountDir> /commit


====== etc wip notes =====
for win 7
cmd:
	dism /image:C:\win_wim_offline /Cleanup-Image /spsuperseded /hidesp
only works on SPs

for win 8+ https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn251565.aspx
	dism /image:C:\win_wim_offline /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
	dism /image:C:\win_wim_offline /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
