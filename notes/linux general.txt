==== for ubuntu generic server ====
notes:
running ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support)

TLDR;
General maintenance.
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade
	sudo reboot



using PPA for apache2 to stay more up to date
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/apache2
	(may have to add again after every major os upgrade)

I also left notes inside the home directory for things that generally need to be done once in a while

because icinga is actually really intensive after reboot (because it wants to ping everybody)
It may be "frozen" after a reboot or if there is no network
Either, log in and stop icinga asap after a reboot
	sudo service icinga2 stop
OR
Wait a really long time for icinga to give up pinging everybody
